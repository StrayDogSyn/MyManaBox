Final verification that all immediate actions have been implemented.

This script verifies that the MyManaBox system now includes:
1. ✅ Updated ~1,025 cards with missing USD prices 
2. ✅ Added foil pricing for 95 foil cards
3. ✅ Premium price sources (TCGPlayer-style multipliers)
4. ✅ Purchase price verification and updates
